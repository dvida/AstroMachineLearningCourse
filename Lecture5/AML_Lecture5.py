# In previous lecture, we talked about unsuperised learning and principal component analysis. We have shown
# how to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and find the most important features.
# We ended with saying that we can see how PCA can be useful to divide the data into nicely separable
# categories.

# In this lecture we will talk about supervised learning, classification in particular where we want the
# algorithm to automatically figure out how to separate the data into different categories.
